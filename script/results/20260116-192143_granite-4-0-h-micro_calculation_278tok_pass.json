  "raw_response": "Thought: To solve this problem, we need to perform two multiplications and then add the results. First, calculate 47 multiplied by 23, then calculate 89 multiplied by 12, and finally add those two products together.\n\n```ruby\nresult = (47 * 23) + (89 * 12)\nfinal_answer(answer: result)\n```\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- 47 * 23 = 1081\n- 89 * 12 = 1068\n- Adding the results: 1081 + 1068 = 2149\n\nTherefore, (47 * 23) + (89 * 12) equals 2149."
