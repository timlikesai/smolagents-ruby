We can do this by trying to divide the number by all integers from 2 up to its square root. If any of these divisions have a remainder of 0, the number is not prime.\n```ruby\ndef is_prime?(num)\n  return false if num <= 1\n\n  (2..Math.sqrt(num)).none? { |i| num % i == 0 }\nend\n\nfinal_answer(answer: \"The is_prime? function checks if a number is prime by checking for divisors from 2 to its square root\")\n```"
