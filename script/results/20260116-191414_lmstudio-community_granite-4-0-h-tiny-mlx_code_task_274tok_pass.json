We'll start by checking for small numbers, then proceed to test divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n\n```ruby\ndef is_prime?(num)\n  return false if num <= 1 # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n  return true if num == 2 # 2 is the only even prime number\n  return false if num.even? # Exclude other even numbers\n\n  sqrt = Math.sqrt(num).to_i\n  (3..sqrt).step(2) do |i|\n    return false if num % i == 0\n  end\n\n  true # If no divisors found, it's prime\nend\n\nfinal_answer(answer: \"The function iterates through odd numbers up to the square root of the input number, returning false if any divisor is found; otherwise, it returns true.\")\n```\n\n\nThought: To determine if a number is prime, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Eliminate numbers less than or equal to 1 as they are not prime.\n2. Recognize that 2 is the only even prime number and handle it separately.\n3. Exclude all other even numbers since they are not prime.\n4. Check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, incrementing by 2 (to skip even numbers).\n\n```ruby\ndef is_prime?(num)\n  return false if num <= 1 # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n  return true if num == 2 # 2 is the only even prime number\n  return false if num.even? # Exclude other even numbers\n\n  sqrt = Math.sqrt(num).to_i\n  (3..sqrt).step(2) do |i|\n    return false if num % i == 0\n  end\n\n  true # If no divisors found, it's prime\nend\n\nfinal_answer(answer: \"The function efficiently checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers after handling small cases.\")\n```\n\nThought: To determine if a number is prime, we need to check for divisibility by all numbers up to its square root. If any number evenly divides it (other than 1 and itself), then it's not prime.\n\n```ruby\ndef is_prime?(num)\n  return false if num <= 1 # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n  return true if num == 2 # 2 is the only even prime number\n  return false if num.even? # Exclude other even numbers\n\n  sqrt = Math.sqrt(num).to_i\n  (3..sqrt).step(2) do |i|\n    return false if num % i == 0\n  end\n\n  true # If no divisors found, it's prime\nend\n\nfinal_answer(answer: \"The function efficiently checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers after handling small cases.\")\n```\n\nThought: To determine if a number is prime, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.\n2. The number 2 is the only even prime number; return true for it.\n3. Exclude all other even numbers since they're not prime.\n4. For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers.\n\n```ruby\ndef is_prime?(num)\n  return false if num <= 1 # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n  return true if num == 2 # 2 is the only even prime number\n  return false if num.even? # Exclude other even numbers\n\n  sqrt = Math.sqrt(num).to_i\n  (3..sqrt).step(2) do |i|\n    return false"
