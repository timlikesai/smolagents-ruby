# Agent Architecture Research Findings

## What is ReAct in language models? What are the key components of the ReAct framework?

## What techniques help language model agents handle tool errors and failures?

Language model agents can handle tool errors and failures by using frameworks like PALADIN. PALADIN trains agents to recognize and recover from tool failures during training, addressing the limitations of existing methods that focus only on successful task completion.

## What is chain-of-thought prompting and how does it help agents?



---

## How should agent prompts be structured? What goes in system prompt vs tool descriptions?

Agent prompts are structured using system prompts for high-level instructions, tool descriptions detailing tool usage, and observation feedback for environmental information. Techniques like PDL and meta prompting aim to improve prompt flexibility and reasoning.
