# smolagents-ruby Project Plan

> **When updating this file:** Remove completed sections, consolidate history, keep it lean.
> The plan should be actionable, not archival. If work is done, collapse it to a single line in Completed.

Delightfully simple agents that think in Ruby.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for vision, patterns, and examples.

## Principles

- **Ship it**: Working software over perfect architecture
- **Simple first**: If it needs explanation, simplify it
- **Test everything**: No feature without tests
- **Delete unused code**: If nothing calls it, remove it
- **Cops guide development**: Fix the code, don't disable the cop

---

## Current Status

**What works:**
- CodeAgent - writes Ruby code, executes tools, returns answers
- ToolCallingAgent - uses JSON tool calling format
- Builder DSL - `Smolagents.code.model{}.tools().build`
- Models - OpenAI, Anthropic, LiteLLM adapters
- Tools - base class, registry, 10+ built-ins
- ToolResult - chainable, pattern-matchable
- Executors - Ruby sandbox, Docker, Ractor isolation
- Event system - Thread::Queue, Emitter/Consumer pattern
- Ruby 4.0 idioms enforced via RuboCop
- Custom cops for event-driven architecture

**Coverage:**
- Code: 92.33% (threshold: 80%)
- Docs: 97.31% (target: 95%)
- Tests: 2982 total, 68 pending

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Events, not callbacks | Events are data (testable). Callbacks are behavior. |
| Thread::Queue | Stdlib. `pop` blocks without polling. |
| Forward-only | Delete unused code. No backwards compatibility. |
| Ractors for execution only | HTTP is I/O-bound, threads work fine |
| No API key serialization | Security - keys at load time |
| Cops guide development | Fix code, don't disable cops |
